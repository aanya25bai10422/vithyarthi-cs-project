# Project Statement – Scientific Calculator (Tkinter)

## 1. Problem Statement

Performing scientific and arithmetic calculations often requires switching between multiple tools or using complex interfaces. Many standard calculators do not offer an intuitive layout or lack essential scientific functions such as trigonometric operations, logarithms, exponentiation, and factorials.
This project aims to build a **simple, user-friendly, and accurate scientific calculator** using Python’s Tkinter library that allows users to perform both basic and advanced mathematical operations within a single application.

## 2. Scope of the Project

The project includes the development of a GUI-based scientific calculator capable of:

### **Basic Operations**

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Percentage and modulus
* Parentheses handling
* Decimal input
* Clear and backspace features

### **Scientific Operations**

* Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan
* Logarithmic functions: log (base 10) and ln
* Square root
* Factorial
* Reciprocal (1/x)
* Pi (π) and Euler’s number (e)
* Degree conversion
* Exponential power operator (^)

### **Additional Scope**

* Tkinter-based interface with button grid layout
* Color-coded buttons for better usability
