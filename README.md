## 🧪 Instructions for Testing

1. Launch the calculator.
2. Test **basic operations**:

   * 2 + 3
   * 5 * (3 + 2)
3. Test **scientific functions**:

   * sin(30)
   * log(100)
   * Sqrt(81)
4. Check invalid input handling:

   * Press "=" without entering anything
   * Enter incomplete expressions like `5+`
5. Compare results with a standard calculator.
